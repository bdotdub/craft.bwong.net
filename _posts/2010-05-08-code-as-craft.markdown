I borrowed the name of this post (and dervied my blog name) from
[Etsy](http://etsy.com)'s new engineering blog,
[Code as Craft](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/). In their
[inaugural post](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2010/02/10/code-as-craft/),
they describe the similarities between craftmanship and software engineering.

The notion of coding as a craft really rang true with me. I view programming
as a field where someone can constantly improve his skills and expertise.
When I see a great piece of code or software, I can't help but admire and be
humbled by it. And when I write code with care and passion, I can't help but
be proud of what I have produced.

So, as I learn more and improve my craft, I thought I'd chronicle it. In
addition, my hope is that some of this will be helpful to someone, since
I've learned tons from others.
